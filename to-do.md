# To-do

### HW1
- Scikit Learn
  - Decisiion Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-nearest neighbors
  - XGBoost

### HW2
- MLP
  - Making a classifier
  - How to load data into a dataset
    - Needs to be both text and image based
  - Soft introduction into Keras
  - Soft introduction into hyperparameters
  
### HW3
- CNN
  - Loading image data
  - Regressions (make sure to emphasize that a regressions and classifications can be done with any neural network)
    - Use hard homework (how to make an image upscaler)
- Preprocessing
  - Importance into preprocessing

### HW4
- RNN
  - Loading text data
  - Generate sentences using the textbook database
  - NEED to rewrite the original tutorial to be more palatable for students
  
### HW5
- Hyperparameter grid search
- Neural network structures? (CNN homework would need to use an autoencoder)

### HW6
- GAN

### Auxillary
- Reinforcement learning
